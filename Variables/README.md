Declare variables (undefined value):\
`var myName;`

Store values:\
`var a;`\
`a = 7;`

Initialise variables:\
`var a = 9;`
  - Can also store variable value to another new variable:\
  `var a;`\
  `a = 7;`\
  `var b;`\
  `b = a;` <- value of `b` is now 7, which was the value of `a`
  
 Variables & function names are case sensitive. Best practice is to utilise camelcase:\
   - `studlyCapVar, properCamelCase, titleCaseOver` are acceptable variable names
