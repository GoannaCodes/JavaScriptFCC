## Number Operations
Addition:\
`var sum = 10 + 10;` <- outputs 20

Subtraction:\
`var diff = 45 - 33;` <- outputs 12

Multiplication:\
`var product = 8 * 10;` <- outputs 80

Division:\
`var quotient = 66 / 33;` <- outputs 2

Incrementing:\
`var myVar = 87;`\
`myVar++;` <- now outputs 88

Decrementing:\
`var myVar = 11;`\
`myVar--;` <- now outputs 10

## Compound Assignment
It is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable.\
There are operators which do both mathematical operation and assignment.

Addition (+=):\
`var a = 3;`\
`a += 12;` <- outputs 15

Subtraction (-=):\
`var b = 9;`\
`b -= 15;` <- outputs -6

Multiplication (*=):\
`var c = 4.6;`\
`c *= 10;` <- outputs 46

Division (/=):\
`var d = 108;`\
`d /= 4;` <- outputs 27

## Remainder
The remainder operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.\
`5 % 2 = 1` since:\
`5 / 2 = 2` and the remainder of `5 - 2(2) = 1`

Often check whether a number is odd or even by:\
`17 % 2 = 1` <- 17 is odd
`48 % 2 = 0` <- 48 is even
